## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and @totalsoft/generator-graphql-rocket using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [NodeJS Latest LTS Version](https://nodejs.org/). Old versions of NodeJS are also supported.)

> ‚ö† Use the npm version supported by your installed NodeJS version.

> e.g. NodeJS Latest LTS Version: 14.17.1 (includes npm 6.14.13)

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g @totalsoft/generator-webapp-rocket
```

If you want to use this generator to scaffold a new project navigate to section: [Generate new project](#generate-new-project)

## Generate new project

To scaffold your new project using our generator run:

```bash
yo @totalsoft/webapp-rocket
```

> ‚ö† Make sure you have the latest version of **GraphQL WebApp Generator** installed, else you will be prompted the following message:

![version](assets/img/versionWarning.png)

You will be prompted to introduce the following information:

1. The project name. This will also be the name of the new folder in which the new application will live. A valid project name, only includes lower and upper case letters, digits and '-' or '\_' separators! No special characters and whitespace are allowed and do not start or end with a separator!
2. Project description. This will be visible in the browser tab and link details.
3. GraphQL address. By default it would be set to `localhost:4000`
4. Use subscription. By default is set to false. This will include the WebSocket link in ApolloClient.
5. Application theme. There is a list of available themes you can choose from.
6. Whether to generate default helm files or not.
7. If you choose to include default helm files you would also be prompted to specify a name for your helm chart. A valid helm chart name, only includes lower case letters, digits and '-' separators! No special characters and whitespace are allowed and do not start or end with a separator!
8. Use rights. By default is set to false. This will also generate a `GET_USER_DATA` query that loads the users rights. (see the query below)
9. Include multi-tenancy. By default is set to false.
10. Would you like to include quick start examples? If so, some end to end examples will be included in your new generated project to help you get started.
11. What package manager you wish to use to install the application dependencies. (npm or yarn).

If you would like to start the application, simply run `npm start` in the newly created folder, otherwise you can begin editing and writing your application!

## Upgrade existing project

‚ö† **First, make sure you have committed everything or have a backup of your existing project.**

‚ö† **RECOMMENDATION!** ‚ö†

---

To avoid having lots of differences, make sure you have **Prettier** formatter installed in your project.
`npm install prettier --dev`

Also a file named **.prettierrc** containing the desired formatting settings is placed in the root of the project. See [Code formatting](#code-formatting) section to see the generator's default config file.

Then apply your formatting rules to the existing files by executing:
`prettier --write **/*.js`

---

To upgrade an existing project that was scaffold using this generator open a console outside of your project folder ( see image below ) and run:

```bash
yo @totalsoft/webapp-rocket
```

![OtsideProjectFolder](assets/img/upgrade_project_name.png)

Now you will be asked to answer the same questions explained in [Generate new project](#generate-new-project) section.

> ‚ö† **ATTENTION!** ‚ö†

> When prompted to enter the name of your project **make sure you enter the name of the project you want to upgrade** ( like shown in the above image ). If you enter a new name, it will generate a new project.

Mainly you have to choose all the options already included in your existing project, or you can add new ones.

> ‚ö† If you decide not to include an option that was previously installed on your existing project (e.g. Authorization), **Yeoman** will not remove files or folders by its own, he just merges existing files or created new ones, and you would have to manually delete the unnecessary files or folders.

After answering all the questions, **Yeoman** will ask you for each file if you want to overwrite it with the latest version. You can type `a`, and this will automatically override all the files, and all the changes could be seen in as changes in your IDE, and it's up to you to check all the changed files before you commit everything.
Or hit **space** to see all your options (see below image).

## What is a Generator?

A Yeoman generator is a scaffolding tool. You can use Yeoman to install applications based on templates. This repository is an example of a template - an application with a build, code structure, and dependencies installed and organized for you!

Using a generator accelerates application development. You don't have to worry about best practices for foundational elements, because we've incorporated them. Our template generates a fully functional web application foundation that becomes the infrastructure of your new project. Before this miracle generator existed, this code would probably took you a few days to write, oh well... now this will be done in only 30 seconds!

We have included integrations with essential libraries, as well as pages, routes, and components that are both useful in most react web applications (like forbidden pages).

Included latest versions of the following libraries and technologies: <b>React, GraphQL, [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client), [AxaGuilDEv/react-oidc](https://github.com/AxaGuilDEv/react-oidc), [@totalsoft/jsbb](https://github.com/osstotalsoft/jsbb), Material-UI, </b> and many more, see generators/app/templates/infrastructure/package.json file.

## Code formatting

The generated code is formatted using the **Prettier** formatter. A file named **.prettierrc** containing the formatting settings is placed in the root of the project.

For maintaining unitary style, the **.prettierrc** configuration file is read by other tools that run **Prettier** such as scripts or IDE extensions. For example if using **Visual Studio Code** we recommend installing the following extension [Prettier formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

In case the **.prettierrc** file is customized, the new settings will be used when re-running the generator. The only condition is to answer **no** when asked to overwrite this file.

The default prettier config file can be found here: [.prettierrc](generators/app/templates/infrastructure/.prettierrc)

## Enforcing Coding Conventions

Ensuring code quality is very important for a maintainable and scalable application. As a default, this generator automatically will install and configure ESLint and Prettier in your project, for a consistent code formatting. ( Read more about this in [Code formatting](#code-formatting) section. ).

To help you enforce this standards, the generator also comes with this great library called **Husky** ( üê∂ woof! ).

**[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)** is a JavaScript package that allows you to run some code during various parts of your git workflow. Husky leverages git hooks to allow you to hook into various git events such as pre-commit and pre-push.

This application uses husky to trigger lint-staged during the pre-commit hook to automate the tedious part of your workflows, such as formatting with Prettier and/or linting with ESLint. Your code gets fixed before it ever leaves your machine, so you don‚Äôt have to wait for your CI to inform you that you forgot to run the formatter or linter.

### ‚ö† Configuring a monorepo with multiple packages

By design, `husky install` must be run in the same directory as `.git`. If your project is a monorepo containing multiple packages, for example a Server and Client sub-folders, husky will expects your `package.json` to be at the root of your project.

If you don't want to add a separate `package.json` in your root just for this, you need to change the husky configurations in your Server and Client projects as follows:

- Change directory during prepare script and pass a subdirectory

```
// clientProject/package.json
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "cd .. && husky install clientProject/.husky"
}
```

```
// serverProject/package.json
"scripts": {
    "prepare": "cd .. && husky install serverProject/.husky"
}
```

- You'll also need to change directory in one of Client or Server hooks and write for both projects

```
// clientProject/.husky/pre-commit
#!/bin/sh
. "$(dirname "$0")/_/husky.sh"

cd serverProject
npx lint-staged
npm run test:ci

cd ../clientProject
npx lint-staged
npm run test:ci
```

- Run `npm install` in both projects and that‚Äôs it! Now if you try to make a commit, you will see that eslint and prettier will run and fix themselves as you would expect.

## Authentication

By default, the application uses <b>Identity SaaS</b>. See [AxaGuilDEv/react-oidc](https://github.com/AxaGuilDEv/react-oidc).  
The authentication is executed using a secure token which will also contain information about the logged user like: user data and roles.

In order to connect your new application to an identity server, the following configuration variables must be filled in `.env` file:
```
IDENTITY_API_URL -> Identity API url, your Identity server API url 

IDENTITY_AUTHORITY -> Identity authority

IDENTITY_OPENID_CONFIGURATION -> Identity openId configuration
```

A user can have one or more roles from the following list:

- admin (tenant_admin)
- user (tenant_user)
- global_admin (only with multi-tenancy)

If you want to use another authentication service, the following files must be modified:

- `src/index.js`
- `src/utils/auth`
- `src/providers/AuthenticationProvider.js`
- `src/components/routing/CustomRoute.js`

‚ö† **RECOMMENDATION!** ‚ö†
It is HIGHLY recommended to use `<CustomRoute />` component when defining a new route. This is an enhanced version of the basic `react-router-dom`'s `<Route />` component. In addition, it allows a more deeper customization of a route and by default it comes with the following configuration parameters:

- <b>isPrivate</b>: if set to True, allows only the logged in users to access the route.
- <b>roles<b/>: a list of predefined roles. For more details see [Authorization](#authorization);
- <b>rights<b/>: a list of predefined rights. For more details see [Authorization](#authorization);
- <b>fullWidth</b>: if set to True, it removes the margins and paddings of the main content of the application screen

## Authorization

When building a web application it is crucial to make it secure, besides token based authentication, there might be the need to limit access to certain areas or even whole pages. We can help you do this too.

If you answered with `true` to the "use rights" question prompted at the beginning, there will be an example of permission checking included in this sample. In addition, there will be some custom hooks to help you (`useUserData` and `useRights`) and the following query will be generated, and it assumes that you have the code implemented in you GraphQL server and database:

```
const GET_USER_DATA = gql`
query userData($externalId: ID!){
  userData(externalId: $externalId){
    id
    userName
    rights
  }
}
`
```

> If you use our [GraphQL Rocket Generator](https://github.com/osstotalsoft/generator-graphql-rocket#code-examples) this will already be done for you.

There are 3 "areas" in your new application where you might want to limit the access:

- Routes: see `src/routes/app` file. Use `roles` and/or `rights` properties to limit the access to a route.
- Side menu: see `src/constants/menuConfig.js` file. Here you will also find the `roles` and`rights` properties that you could use to limit the access to a certain menu item.
- Small parts of your react components or even an element: here you can use the `useRights` custom hook explained bellow.

To define a new role, assuming it was already added in the database, you should export it from `src/constants/permissions` file.

## Notifications

This project uses [react-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction) to display friendly, smart and colorful toasts.  
Read further to see some use cases.

## Custom hooks

- `useQueryWithErrorHandling` - runs the query and automatically displays an error toast in case of some error occurs.
- `useClientQueryWithErrorHandling` - runs the query using Apollo Client instance and display an error toast in case of an error.
- `useError` - displays an error toast with a friendly message.
- `useToast` - allows you to display a custom toast
- `useApolloLocalStorage` - retrieves a getter and a seetter pair for a certain key from Apollo client cache (used to handle local storage).
- (Optional) `useUserData` - executes a default query to load the current user information (including a list of rights)
- (Optional) `useRights`- verifies if the current logged user has a specific right.

## Internationalization

Internationalization (commonly known as i18n) is a core part of many web applications. We have integrated the sample application with the common i18n tool, called react-i18next, which is a React plugin for the popular i18next plugin.

Our language and translation files are added as JSON files stored in the application. You can find the files in the installed application, under the public/locales folder.  
Here you will find a folder per supported language, with a translation.json file inside.

## Multi-tenancy

If you need to handle multi-tenancy in your new application, you can just reply with `yes` when you are being prompted about this topic at the beginning and voil√†! Everything will be done for you.

This feature include a `TenantSelector` component, which allows a user to navigate to multiple tenants. This uses a `MY_TENANTS_QUERY` GraphQL query, which retrieves the same information exposed by <b>Identity SAAS</b>. This will have to be implemented in your GraphQL server.

> If you use our [GraphQL Rocket Generator](https://github.com/osstotalsoft/generator-graphql-rocket#multi-tenancy), it will include all of the missing code elements you need to make this work.

```
export const MY_TENANTS_QUERY = gql`
  query {
    myTenants {
    externalId
    name
    code
    tier
    isActive
    tenant {
    id
    name
    code
    }
  }
}
`
```

In addition, the default `AuthenticationProvider` will be replaced with a specialized one who manages the multi-tenancy logic.

## Deployment

When you are ready you can deploy you application on any platform. This template also includes a pre-configured Dockerfile and optional Helm files.
Application (or non-system) containers security can be enhanced by running as a non-root user. This can reduce the damage done by a malicious actor that gains access to the application and the underlying system, because it will have only the rights assigned to that user (for example it will not be able to install arbitrary software). Once the project is generated, a user is created for your project. Default name is "appuser". You can change the name in Dockerfile. Also, the application will listen on 8080 port by default. This port can be change in Dockerfile and in helm/values.yaml.yaml. Because the application will no longer run as root, the port must be greater than 1024.
